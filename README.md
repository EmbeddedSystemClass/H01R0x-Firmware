# H01R00 Module #

**H01R00 is a smart RGB LED module** based on Cree CLVBA-FKA-CC1F1L1BB7R3R3 RGB LED and STM32F0 MCU. It is part of the upcoming Hexabitz modular prototyping system.

- Use as a stand-alone smart RGB LED and easily control via a Command Line Interface (CLI).
- Firmware has embedded on / off / toggle, PWM, dimming and color sweep functionality.
- Program advanced C code with our easy-to-use APIs.
- Connect many H01R00 modules together and build interesting flat and curved boards with any configuration you imagine!
- Send commands to a single LED, a group of LEDs or broadcast to all of them at the same time.
- Connect to external hardware or combine with other Hexabitz modules!

## About Hexabitz ##

Hexabitz is a new kind of electronic prototyping platforms with game-changing modularity and a hint of biomimicry. Hexabitz modules connect with each other using a novel edge-soldering system and allow you to build tidy, compact and completely re-configurable electronic boards. **Learn more about Hexabitz [here](https://www.hexabitz.com/)**.

## Documentation ##
We developed a new form of documentation we call it the Factsheet: it's a mix between a hardware datasheet listing electrical properties and a software cheat-sheet showing you quickly the most important software functions and commands. Factsheets are color-coded and designed to be printed double-sided. We think they will come in handy for your Hexabitz projects. Let us know if you like them!

## FAQ ##

### Q: Isn't a 32-bit MCU an overkill for a smart LED module? ###
A: Yes! But all Hexabitz modules -whether it's a complex Ethernet or IMU or a simple LED- share same backend hardware and software. This what gives the platform its unmatched modularity and scalability. Cortex-M0 MCUs are small, cheap, power-efficient, yet capable of really wonderful things. Having an embedded MCU provides a cheaper and more compact alternative to connecting an LED breakout with an external controller.

### Q: What level of soldering experience is required? ###
A: Hexabitz are designed for the absolute soldering beginners! The edge pads are large and easy to reach and anyone with basic knowledge of soldering can assemble a flat array. Curved and spherical arrays require more training but can be made easier with 3d-printed fixtures.
